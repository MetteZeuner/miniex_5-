<h3>My Program<h3>

<h6>My program evolves around a passage from the book “Lord of the Rings” that I found online. When you click on the different themes, the passage changes some of its word making the story correspond with the theme. The inspiration of my program is based upon some fun examples I saw online, where words from books are changed thus making it a lot funnier or weirder. My idea is just for fun and should not be taken seriously in any way.<h6>

<h3>Function used from RiTa library<h3>

<h6>Sadly I couldn’t make my program work using RiTa library, either because i’m simply not able to wrap my mind around how to use RiTa correctly or maybe the references do not work properly. I sought out help from my instructor who couldn’t get it to work either. My plan was to use the “replaceWord” reference from the RiTa library, making the program actually replace the words. I choose to demonstrate the concept of my program through p5js, not actually making the program actually replace the words but creating the illusion that it does. The changing background color and music is just an extra touch to emphasize the themes, and also because I had set myself the goal of learning to implement sound this week because I hadn’t been able to make sound work for my program last week.<h6>
