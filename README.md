<h1>Lord of the Themes<h1> 

Run program (WARNING! - do not click on the buttons too quickly after each other – for some the reason the program can’t handle this and begins to play the music on top of each other, which is not a pleasant experience.. and also for the sake of your ears, I do not recommend listening to this with headphones on, since I can’t guarantee the loudness of the music!):  <https://mettezeuner.github.io/miniex_5-/empty-example/>

<h3>My Program<h3>

<h6>My program evolves around a passage from the book “Lord of the Rings” that I found online. When you click on the different themes, the passage changes some of its word making the story correspond with the theme. The inspiration of my program is based upon some fun examples I saw online, where words from books are changed thus making it a lot funnier or weirder. My idea is just for fun and should not be taken seriously in any way.<h6>

<h3>Functions used from RiTa library<h3>

<h6>Sadly I couldn’t make my program work using RiTa library, either because i’m simply not able to wrap my mind around how to use RiTa correctly or maybe the references do not work properly. I sought out help from my instructor who couldn’t get it to work either. My plan was to use the “replaceWord” reference from the RiTa library, making the program actually replace the words. I choose to demonstrate the concept of my program through p5js, not actually making the program actually replace the words but creating the illusion that it does. The changing background color and music is just an extra touch to emphasize the themes, and also because I had set myself the goal of learning to implement sound this week because I hadn’t been able to make sound work for my program last week.<h6>

<h3>How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text?<h3>

<h6>Like the text says a big part of the materiality of the text/interface lies within the interaction of the user. For my program the interaction also plays a big part because the program does not just shift between the different themes by itself– the user has to click the theme, listen to the music and read and interpret the text – the user therefore plays an essential part of making this program work as intended.<h6>
